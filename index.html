      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a mechanical engineer and researcher specializing in composite materials, impact modeling, and machine learning. 
        My work bridges experimental testing, numerical simulation, and AI-driven design tools to tackle real-world challenges in advanced materials.
        Beyond research, I'm passionate about teaching and mentorship—whether it's guiding students through their first design course or 
        demonstrating how data science can enhance engineering decisions. I believe in empowering the next generation of engineers to think critically, work ethically, and embrace interdisciplinary innovation.
